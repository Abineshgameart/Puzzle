## Gameplay Mechanics
### 1. Level 1: 4x4 Number Puzzle

* **Objective:** Arrange the scrambled numbered tiles in sequential order (1 through 15) within a 4x4 grid. Players slide tiles into an empty space to reorganize them until all numbers are in their correct positions.
* **Core Mechanics:** Players must slide adjacent tiles into the empty space using drag-and-drop mechanics.

### 2. Level 2: 6x6 Image Puzzle
* **Objective:** Rearrange the shuffled tiles of an image to restore the original picture. Players can move the image tiles into the empty space one at a time.
* **Core Mechanics:** Similar to the number puzzle, but this time players are required to remember the full image and strategize to put all tiles in their correct positions.

### 3. Level 3: 8x8 Image Puzzle
* **Objective:** Complete a complex 8x8 sliding image puzzle. The increased number of tiles makes the puzzle much harder, requiring attention to detail and excellent memory recall.
* **Core Mechanics:** The challenge here is greater precision, as the 8x8 grid leaves little room for error, and players must plan their moves carefully.
